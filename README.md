# 🚀 IoSC Mentorship Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects developed as part of the **IoSC Mentorship Program**.

The projects focus on building strong fundamentals in:
- Data preprocessing  
- Model development  
- Model evaluation & comparison  
- Writing clean, reproducible machine learning code  

This repository will be continuously updated with new projects exploring different algorithms, techniques, and real-world datasets.

- Random Forest Regressor (ensemble model with hyperparameter tuning)  

**Key ML practices applied:**
- Missing value handling  
- Train–test split  
- Cross-validation  
- Multiple evaluation metrics
